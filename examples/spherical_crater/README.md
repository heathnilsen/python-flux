# `spherical_crater`

The steady state flux and temperature have an analytical solution in
the case of a crater in the shape of a spherical cap, even in the
presence of occlusion (see [Ingersoll et
al. 1992](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001910359290016Z)). We
use this analytical solution to test the accuracy of our model. This
example runs a variety of tests and collects the results into tables
and figures.
